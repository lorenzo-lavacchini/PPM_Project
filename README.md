# PPM_Project
Functionalities implemented:

* Users can register, login and logout.
* All users (logged in and not logged in) can view in the home page all the recipes posted from all users.
* For each recipe there is a detail page in wich it's displayed also the recipe description.
* Every recipe belongs to a certain food category. New food categories can be added by the site manager 
  using the administration console.
* Logged users can create new recipe: the author will be set automatically to be the user himself.
* A logged user has the possibility to update and delete a recipe, only if he is the recipe author.
 This is accomplished by hiding the buttons to access these functionalities in the details page for the recipes.
* A logged user can set a recipe to be 'favorite', and he can view the favorite recipes in the page 'View Favorites'.
* Every user can look for a particular recipe based on its title using the search bar.
